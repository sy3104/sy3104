### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Satoshi Yoshida, a PhD student in the Department of Physics, the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. Mio Murao.

My research is on
- Quantum information theory
- Higher-order quantum transformations
- Quantum error correction

with the techniques based on
- Semidefinite programming
- Group theory, Representation theory
- Stabilizer simulations

I am sharing the computational codes used for my research, mainly based on semidefinite programming.
